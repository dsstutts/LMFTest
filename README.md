# LMTest
Example of the use of the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm as implemented in Python by the leastsq function from scipy.optimize.
Also included is expdatgen.py, which generates a data file, data.txt, containing tab-delimited x,y data generated by the function: F(x) = 0.625 + 1.33*exp(-0.5*x).  

LMTest.py is then invoked to estimate the paramters a, b, c, for F(x) = a + b*exp(c*x).  The estimated parameters are printed to std-out, and the data and modal are plotted with the plot annotated with the standard error.
